Achievements are steps along the way toward earning a Badge.

# Responsibilities
An Achievement carries the following properties:

* Name / Title
* Type of Post
* Step / Post ID
* Date Earned

# Collaboration

## Badge or Criteria/Step
An Achievement may be a Badge, but more typically, it is a completed step
toward earning a badge.

## User
Achievements are closely related to a User. (In BadgeOS, they are stored
in the WP_USERMETA table.)
