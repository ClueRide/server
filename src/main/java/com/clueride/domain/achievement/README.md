Achievements are steps along the way toward earning a Badge.

# Responsibilities
An Achievement carries the following properties:

* Name
* Image URL
* Level (to show the color Aware, Adept, Advocate, Angel)
* Flag indicating whether it has been completed by a given user.
* List of child Achievements

# Collaboration

## Badge
An Achievement may be a Badge. The Achievement ID would match the Badge ID.

## User
Along with a User, we can show which specific achievements have been accomplished. This serves to turn on/off the flags.

## Child Achievement instances
By counting the list of completed children and comparing to the full list,
we can indicate progress toward the Achievement, and ultimately, what
remains to be completed to earn the next badge.
